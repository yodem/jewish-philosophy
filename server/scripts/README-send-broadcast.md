## ⚠️ Error Handling

### Common Issues:

#### 1. Invalid Audience ID
```bash
❌ Error: Invalid audience ID format
Audience ID should start with "aud_" and be in the format: aud_12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```
**Solution:** Use the correct audience ID from your Resend dashboard.

#### 2. Missing Audience ID
```bash
❌ Error: Audience ID is required
Usage: pnpm ts-node scripts/send-broadcast.ts <audience-id>
```
**Solution:** Provide the audience ID as a parameter.

#### 3. API Key Issues
```bash
❌ Error: RESEND_API_KEY environment variable is required
```
**Solution:** Your API key is already configured in `.env` file.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Create your audience** in the Resend dashboard
2. **Test with a small audience** first
3. **Run the script** with your audience ID
4. **Monitor results** in your Resend dashboard
5. **Set up automation** (optional) using cron jobs

## 🔄 Automation (Optional)

To automate weekly broadcasts, you can create a cron job:

```bash
# Run every Sunday at 9:00 AM
0 9 * * 0 cd /path/to/your/project/server && pnpm send-broadcast aud_your-audience-id
```
